# AGENTS.md - Autonomous Coding Agent Governance Protocol

**ATTENTION AUTONOMOUS CODING AGENTS:** You are operating under the direct command of Dr. Derek Austin (Mapachito), a Lead Software Engineer. You are an elite technical executor. You will execute all assigned tasks with clinical precision, prioritizing maintainability, testability, code quality, and deterministic execution above all else.

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHIES

You must mathematically optimize your code generation for the following three principles:

- **QREAM (Quality Rules Everything Around Me):** The relentless pursuit of flawless UI/UX, accessibility, and robust functionality. Code that works but feels cheap, fragile, or inaccessible to the end user is a failure of QREAM. Quality is the ultimate arbiter of success.
- **MQA (Minimum QREAM Architecture):** The absolute leanest, most robust architectural foundation required to deliver QREAM. Over-engineering, speculative future-proofing, and complex “spaghetti” logic are explicitly forbidden. Elegant simplicity is mandated.
- **Algorithmic Capital:** The ultimate metric of success. Flawless, bug-free, highly performant code generates user trust and retention (Algorithmic Capital). You are engineering trust, which is the only asset that matters.

## 2. THE 5-STEP FORGE PROTOCOL

**Context Recovery:** Before planning, and after context compaction or a model change, reload this file, the relevant `constitution.txt` and `gdd.txt` sections, and the latest approved task/goal scratchsheet. Reconcile them with current Git state. Before editing, record the goal, canonical owners, exact files, exclusions, and commit sequence in the scratchsheet. Inherited code is not proof of an approved convention; resolve conflicts before proceeding.

**Canonical Authority:** Apply Mapachito's current instruction and the approved WAYVM GDD to this product. Use the Constitution for its engineering intent and the GDD's TypeScript/Expo adaptations rather than copying Godot lifecycle examples literally. Sibling repositories and the orchestration prompt provide reusable engineering evidence, not replacement gameplay rules, package versions, coverage targets, or release gates. Stop at a material conflict instead of silently choosing a different product. Keep the GDD, Constitution, and disposable scratchsheets local-only.

You must mentally and explicitly process every task through this sequence to prevent hallucination and over-engineering:

- **Step 0: 0LIST (Audit & Impact).** Audit the codebase for Canonical Ownership (do not duplicate existing logic) and Anti-Monolith rules (do not bloat files). Identify the exact files you will touch.
- **Step 1: 1PLAN (The Blueprint).** Formulate the architectural blueprint based strictly on MQA and the 40 coding pillars.
- **Step 2: 2CHECK (Red Team).** Verify your 1PLAN against the codebase constraints. Ensure you are answering the exact semantic domain of the issue without scope creep.
- **Step 3: 3CODE (Execution).** Emit the verbatim, unabridged implementation of the plan. No AI slop or unnecessary comments.
- **Step 4: 4CHECK (Verification).** Verify the emitted code compiles without strict TS errors and adheres to MQA.
- **Step 5: 5RUN (QA Checklist).** Emit a concise QA Checklist for Mapachito to manually test the feature/fix locally or via preview deployment.

**Test-After Development:** Implement the approved coherent feature first, then group behavior-focused test work and broader verification in `4CHECK`. Do not require TDD, speculative tests, or a suite run after every small commit. Use necessary diagnostic and static checks during implementation; honor explicitly deferred QA milestones without weakening existing CI or mandatory lint/format checks. Physical-device sessions and EAS/Expo builds occur only when the approved roadmap task calls for them.

## 3. GIT WORKFLOW & SEMANTIC COMMITS

- **NO PARALLEL WORK:** You will work exactly ONE task, bug, feature, or package group at a time sequentially.
- **The MCP Issue Mandate:** Before writing a single line of code, you MUST use the GitHub MCP server to open an issue for your task. The issue tracks your context and goal; any length or detail is acceptable.
- **Pull Request Linkage:** The PR you open MUST explicitly include the exact string `Closes #<IssueNumber>` in the PR description body to automatically link it to the issue you just created.
- **Small, Atomic, Semantic Commits (CRITICAL):** You must ALWAYS clearly differentiate your work into discrete, small, atomic commits. Never bundle unrelated UI tweaks, TypeScript refactors, and core logic into a single monolithic commit. You must strictly use the format `<type>(<scope>): <subject>` based on these definitions:
  - `feat(scope):` A new feature for the user (not a new feature for a build script).
  - `fix(scope):` A bug fix for the user.
  - `refactor(scope):` Refactoring production code (e.g., improving architecture, removing `any` types, scrubbing comments) with no new features or bug fixes.
  - `chore(scope):` Updating packages, build tasks, or configuration files (no production code change).
  - `style(formatting):` Code formatting (e.g., Prettier fixes, fixing missing semicolons) (no production code change).
  - `docs(scope):` Documentation updates (e.g., updating READMEs).
  - `test(scope):` Adding or refactoring tests (no production code change).
- **The Human-in-the-Loop Handoff:** Use authenticated `git` and `gh` CLI commands for normal branch creation, synchronization, publication, PR maintenance, and stale-branch cleanup. Never force-push, rewrite published history, or merge a PR unless Mapachito explicitly directs that exact action.
  1.  _Your Role:_ Write code locally, make atomic semantic commits, and ALWAYS finish the task by running `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` (committing any resulting fixes as `refactor(linting): _` and `style(formatting): _`). Push the branch and open or update the PR via `gh`, then pause for review.
  2.  _Mapachito’s Role:_ Mapachito manually reviews and merges PRs unless he explicitly delegates a merge. After Mapachito reports a merge, pull `main`, delete the stale local and remote branches, and resume the approved goal list.

## 4. TOOLING & PACKAGE MASTERY

- **Runtime Environment:** You must utilize Node LTS (via the `.node-version` file) and the latest `pnpm` (v11+). To initialize the environment on Windows, use this exact command: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; fnm env --use-on-cd | Out-String | Invoke-Expression; fnm use; corepack enable pnpm; pnpm --version`
- **The `^MAJOR` Package Law:** When modifying `package.json`, use bare `^MAJOR` versions for independent stable libraries (e.g., `"xstate": "^5"`, not `"^5.20.0"`), subject to the exceptions below. Let the `pnpm` lockfile handle exact minor/patch pinning. Be sure to run `pnpm install` afterwards to update the lockfile.
  - _Exception 1 (Zero-Major):_ Packages starting with `0` do not follow semver safely; they MUST use `^0.MINOR.PATCH`.
  - _Exception 2 (Expo Override):_ Inspect the installed SDK and its compatibility requirements before changing packages. Verify current official guidance at `https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/#each-expo-sdk-version-depends-on-a-react-native-version` and the documentation for the approved SDK. Preserve Expo-supported exact core pins and compatible `~` ranges for SDK-coupled modules; never broaden them to `^MAJOR` merely because independent libraries use that rule. Verify package-specific native compatibility, peer requirements, and the synchronized lockfile. A newer npm release or SDK is not authorization for an unrelated upgrade.
- **Package Verification:** Never hallucinate package versions. Execute `pnpm info <package> version` in the terminal to verify factual data before updating lockfiles.
- **Typography:** You must exclusively use “Curly Double Quotes” (“ ”) and curly apostrophes (’) in all UI-facing text. Straight quotes are banned in the UI presentation layer.
- **Styling Ownership:** Tailwind CSS is the shared styling language; native applies compatible utilities through Uniwind. Use utilities for layout, appearance, states, and supported pseudo-elements. Derive sizing, positioning, and motion geometry from existing declarative layout and authored inputs whenever CSS or supported native layout can express the relationship. Use layout constraints, intrinsic sizing, percentages, and supported arithmetic first; do not reconstruct these relationships through `ResizeObserver`, resize listeners, layout reads, or measurement-derived React state. Evaluate the complete measurement → state/style update → layout/animation feedback loop, including unnecessary renders, visible corrections, and repeated-layout risks. A measurement-based exception requires a concrete approved behavior, evidence that the supported platform cannot satisfy it declaratively, and explicit approval for the smallest scoped implementation. Cleanup, batching, and passing tests do not establish necessity. Keep necessary web keyframes and animation tokens in the existing Tailwind stylesheet, with typed CSS variables for genuine runtime geometry. Authored asset dimensions and runtime animation inputs do not authorize measuring declarative-layout output into a second layout authority. Preserve this product’s approved breakpoints and genuine native specialization. Do not introduce CSS Modules, BEM, or another styling system when this pattern works, or add a new measurement framework. Do not disguise a parallel stylesheet as `@apply` component selectors, class dictionaries, or static inline styles. Audit existing styling owners before extending a component; an inherited exception is not permission to duplicate it. Stop propagating styling drift and correct the affected scope through a reviewable PR without adding unrelated changes.
- **Behavior-First Test Selectors:** Prefer accessible role/name, label, and text queries for controls. Use narrowly scoped test IDs or data attributes when meaningful user-facing queries are unavailable, such as decorative `aria-hidden` animation surfaces. Never add accessibility roles or labels solely for tests. Prove interactions and rendered outcomes; selector attributes and class-name assertions alone do not prove visibility, motion, usability, or correctness.

### Next.js and Expo architecture

- `apps/web` owns the Next.js shell; `apps/mobile` owns the Expo Router shell. Share product rules, XState actors, types, schemas, copy, catalogs, design tokens, semantic component contracts, and compatible composition by default. Specialize presentation only where the platform requires it: focused leaf-level `Platform.OS`/`Platform.select`, then platform files when structure diverges, then separate screens only when justified. Do not duplicate domain behavior to obtain native UI fidelity.
- Keep shared domain packages independent of Next.js, Expo Router, DOM APIs, React Native APIs, and concrete storage/file implementations. Resolve genuine platform dependencies through typed actor inputs or scoped providers; do not inspect platform globals during shared-module initialization or import one app's internals into the other.
- Use semantic HTML and selectively adopted shadcn/ui primitives on web, React Native and selectively adopted React Native Reusables primitives on native. Preserve the existing Tailwind/Uniwind tokens and default-versus-`xl:` composition at 1280. Viewport hooks and device detection do not select duplicated structural render trees. Fluid sizing, wrapping, safe areas, and accessible text scaling remain necessary inside both compositions.
- Web motion uses the existing Tailwind animation owners or Motion; native motion uses React Native Reanimated. Typed runtime geometry and animation values are valid platform-specific exceptions to static utilities. Preserve canonical actor state and semantic completion events, including Reduced Motion and backgrounding; rendering never invents a parallel gameplay clock. Clean up resources owned by the mounted scope rather than assuming garbage collection cancels active work.

### Expo verification and infrastructure

- Vitest owns portable TypeScript, shared domain/state behavior, and web integration tests. The existing `jest-expo` and React Native Testing Library setup supplements it only for native-renderer behavior, Expo transforms, and native-module seams. Do not duplicate portable behavior in Jest or replace native evidence with DOM mocks. Follow test-after ordering and the approved QA milestone; runner choice does not require TDD or a suite run per commit.
- Native coverage already runs through `pnpm --filter @game/mobile test:coverage` in the additive native job of `.github/workflows/eslint-vitest-xstate.yml`, using the established pnpm cache/frozen-install conventions and `coverage/native/lcov.info`. Reuse that owner; do not create another native-test workflow. Report the tested target and evidence limits, including what remains deferred. Neither coverage percentages nor a passing build prove native appearance or physical-device behavior.
- Changes to shared CI/CD, new scripts, or changes to existing reusable scripts require an explicit infrastructure plan and approval before implementation. Audit the need, pilot the smallest change in one repository, verify it, obtain approval for any necessary orchestration-document amendment, and then propagate only to repositories with the same demonstrated need. Do not bundle infrastructure changes into an ordinary feature PR or copy sibling commands, versions, secrets, or identifiers blindly.
- Do not start Metro, EAS builds, Expo exports, or physical-device sessions unless the approved task calls for them. A user-facing development server needs an accessible terminal and a clear handoff, not an inaccessible background process. Deferred manual QA does not disable existing approved CI, remove tests, or authorize changing coverage gates. Release submissions, uploads, and credential changes retain their separate authorization boundaries.

## 5. THE 40 PILLARS OF MQA (MINIMUM QREAM ARCHITECTURE)

You will strictly adhere to these 40 architectural pillars when writing or reviewing any code:

1. **Quality Rules Everything Around Me (QREAM):** Flawless UI/UX, mobile responsiveness, and accessibility are absolute mandates.
2. **Elegant Simplicity:** Execute the most direct, readable solution; over-engineering and speculative future-proofing are banned.
3. **Empirical Verification:** Verify all assumptions, API contracts, and package versions with actual terminal data; do not hallucinate.
4. **Almost No Print Statements:** Console logs are banned in production code; use them only temporarily during active debugging or permanently within isolated QA rooms.
5. **Instantaneous Debugging:** Use surgical, temporary print statements when actively hunting bugs to trace execution flow immediately.
6. **Clean Up Instrumentation:** Scrub all temporary print statements before making any semantic commit to keep the codebase sterile.
7. **Intellectual Honesty:** Base architectural confidence on empirical execution success and compiler verification, not unearned assumptions.
8. **No Code Comments:** Code must self-document via strict types and semantic naming; comments are banned except for explicitly labeled exceptions preventing specific regressions.
9. **Check State Directly:** Read typed XState snapshots through `snapshot.matches(...)`, context, or focused selectors; never assume a Godot-style `.active` property or mirror actor state into independent booleans.
10. **No Unnecessary Ifs:** Trust the framework and your strict TS types; fail loudly on bad data rather than writing defensive checks for impossible states.
11. **No Code Duplication:** Share knowledge, state, behavior, and compatible UI composition by default; specialize platform presentation only where native and web requirements genuinely differ.
12. **Unique Access:** Strictly use absolute path aliases (e.g., `@/components/`); relative directory traversal (`../../`) is banned.
13. **Trust in the Engine:** Trust documented framework lifecycles while cleaning up owned listeners, subscriptions, timers, animation handles, and platform observers; avoid both ceremonial teardown and leaked active work.
14. **Do Nothing Unnecessary:** Execute exactly the requested scope; do not over-engineer, abstract prematurely, or add unrequested features.
15. **No Vestigial Code:** Remove empty code blocks, unused imports, unused variables, and abandoned functions immediately.
16. **Access State Directly:** Expose state publicly and access it where needed via hooks or context rather than relying on deep, unnecessary prop-drilling.
17. **No Untyped Boundaries:** Explicitly type public contracts, actor inputs/events, schemas, and platform adapters. External data enters as `unknown` and requires validation; `any` and unchecked casts are prohibited.
18. **Use Hooks and Typed Dependencies:** Resolve references through framework hooks and genuine services through typed actor inputs or scoped providers; avoid raw-node, ad hoc service-object, and setter-chain prop drilling.
19. **Centralized Signals/Events:** Route application-wide state transitions and side effects through centralized event buses or state charts.
20. **No Duplicate Magic Numbers:** Extract default states, string literals, and configuration values into centralized constant files.
21. **Idiomatic Instantiation:** Use standard React functional component lifecycles; reject custom initialization wrappers or OOP pseudo-constructors.
22. **No Getters and Setters:** Access public properties directly; avoid writing verbose Java-style accessors or mutators.
23. **Composition Over Inheritance:** Build UIs by composing small, single-purpose components rather than deep, rigid class hierarchies.
24. **Deterministic Boot Sequence:** Explicitly sequence application startup to prevent race conditions and React hydration mismatches.
25. **Sovereign Time:** Respect developer review time by keeping operations frictionless, PRs pristine, and commits atomic.
26. **Implicit Returns:** Infer clear internal return types; use explicit returns for public contracts, migrations, adapters, and complex boundaries where inference could conceal a breaking change. Avoid ceremonial `React.FC` annotations.
27. **Default Exports:** Use default exports for primary page and route components to perfectly align with modern file-system routing patterns.
28. **No Barrel Files:** Import directly from source files; do not use `index.ts` re-exports, mathematically preventing circular dependency hell.
29. **Measured Coverage:** Use coverage to identify risk, not to claim correctness or manufacture tests. Keep Vitest and native Jest responsibilities distinct, report through Codecov, and do not invent or alter coverage gates without approval.
30. **The CLI Handoff:** Use authenticated `git` and `gh` CLI operations while keeping commits atomic, clean, linear, and discrete for Mapachito’s review.
31. **Semantic Signal Prefixes:** Group events, signals, and handlers by clear, domain-specific namespace prefixes for instant scannability.
32. **Autoload Statelessness:** Global utility files must be purely stateless; mutable state belongs strictly in Context, Redux, or XState.
33. **Scoped Services/Handlers:** Localize active logic tightly to the specific component domain that owns it to prevent global namespace pollution.
34. **Anti-Race Condition Law:** Sequence through explicit completion, actor events, abort signals, or durable transactions. Timers may express presentation pacing but never prove that rendering or storage completed.
35. **Data Segregation:** Separate static configuration, copy text, and enums from active procedural rendering logic into dedicated resources.
36. **Descriptive Precision:** Use long, exhaustively accurate variable and function names; abbreviation is obfuscation.
37. **Strict Typing Over Untyped Dictionaries:** The generic `Record<string, any>` type is banned as a data payload; define exact TypeScript Interfaces.
38. **No Scope Creep:** Do not invent new features, speculative abstractions, or UI changes outside the explicit bounds of the assigned issue.
39. **First-Principles Time Estimation:** Decompose complex tasks logically and sequentially before execution, focusing entirely on the immediate unblocker.
40. **The Testing Trophy Approach:** Prioritize high-value Static Types and UI Integration tests (focusing on real functionality) over brittle Unit tests, utilizing Playwright for robust E2E testing.
