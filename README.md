## Current build

The public web application currently includes:

- 100 immutable canonical values with definitions.
- Private Custom Value create, edit, and delete flows.
- Durable local persistence through IndexedDB, with no account required.
- A deterministic XState state machine and lazy pair scheduler.
- First-run browsing, rank-preserving search, All Values, Top Five, and visible definitions.
- Undo and Redo for battle history.
- Schema-validated JSON backup import and export.
- Local achievement progression and presentation.
- An installable static PWA with a precached application shell for offline reloads.
- Responsive keyboard- and touch-friendly web UI.

## Release status

The public release is web-only. The Expo workspace implements the same private core loop, durable local persistence, JSON import/export, and local achievements. Its canonical build gate exports both iOS and Android bundles. An EAS-signed Android development build has been installed and smoke-tested on a physical device. Deeper Android lifecycle and accessibility QA, iOS signing and device QA, and store submissions remain pending.

## Native iteration

Start an installed Expo development build with:

```powershell
pnpm mobile:dev
```

If a compatible Expo Go client is available, start its development server with:

```powershell
pnpm mobile:go
```

Validate Expo compatibility and export both native JavaScript bundles with:

```powershell
pnpm mobile:doctor
pnpm mobile:export
```

Export proves that Metro can resolve the JavaScript and assets for both native platforms. It does not prove native compilation, signing, installation, physical-device behavior, or store acceptance.

## Technology

- TypeScript 6, pnpm, and Turborepo.
- Next.js 16 App Router and React 19.
- Tailwind CSS 4 and source-owned shadcn/ui primitives.
- Expo 57, React Native 0.86, Expo Router, Uniwind, React Native Reanimated, and source-owned React Native Reusables primitives.
- XState 5 for application state and Motion for web animation.
- Vitest, Testing Library, Playwright, Codecov, GitHub Actions, and Vercel.

## Local development

Use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) for Node version management and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager:

```powershell
fnm use
corepack enable pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Build and preview the static production PWA locally with:

```powershell
pnpm --filter @game/web build
pnpm --filter @game/web start
```

## Verification

```powershell
pnpm lint
pnpm format
pnpm test
pnpm test:coverage
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm build
```
